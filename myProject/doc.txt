The Process behind building the website

Define: 
Define who is the website for? Is it for your self? For the client of your agency or your freelancing business?
Define what the website is for? In other words, define business and user goals of your website project(see lecture on UX)
Plan

Example:
Business goal example: Selling preminum dog food
User goal example: Finding high quality dog food for good price

Define the target audience 
Be Specific if possible and if it makes sense for your website (this come from your project)

Exmaple:
Woman 20 to 40 year old, living in Europe, earning over 2000 Euro per month, with a passion for dogs

Plan
Plan the project
plan and gather website content: copy(text), images, videos etc
Content is usually provided by the client, but you also can help them produce and find some content (simply Finding
free images is easiest, but if they want copy, charge them extra)

For bigger website, plan out the sidemap, what pages the site needs, and how they are related to one another(content hierarchy)
Based on the content plan what sections each page needs in order to convey the contents message and in which order

Define the website personality (see the web Design section)

Sketch
Sketch Layout and Component ideas
Think about the componets needed, how you can use them in layout patterns, (Get inspiration in web design section)

Its the content which should guide the website not the design

Get Ideas out of your head: sketch them with pen and paper or with some design software(eg Figma)
The Sketched should be very low fedility with very low details

This is an iterative process, experiment with different component solution and layouts, until you arrive at the first good
solution

You dont need to sketch everything, and dont make it perfect, At some point you are ready to jump into HTML and css


Design and building
Use Decisions, content and sketches from step 1, 2 and 3 to design and build the website with HTML and css 
(desigining in the browser)

You alrwady have the layout and component that you selected in Step 3. In this step, you need to desgin the actual
visual styles

Use the clients branding(it if exists already) for desgin Decisions whenever possible: colors, typography icons etc

Test and Optimize
Make sure website works well in all major browser, (chrome, firefox, edge, even old IE)
Test the website on actual Mobile Devices, not just on Developer tools
Optimize all the images, in terms of dimensions and file size(see lection on images)
  - Give the right dimensions in pixels
  - compress them in order to not forse our user to download huge images, thats a bad user experience
Fix simple accessibilty issues(eg color contrast issues)
Run the lighthouse performance test in chrome devtools and try to fix reported issues 
THink about Search engine Optimization

Launch
Once all the work is done, everything is perfect, and you got approval from client or yourself, its time
to share your master peice with the world

Upload your website files to a hosting platform. There are countless platform, we will use one witht he free plan(Netlify)

Chosse and buy a great domain name, one that is representing the brand well and is memorable and easy to write

Maintain and Update
Launching the website is not the end 
keep the website content updated over time. If you are working with the client, you can create a monthy maintainance
contract(recurring revenue)

install some kind of analytic software(Google analytic or fathom ) to get statistics about the website users. This may
inform future changes in site structure and content

A blog that is updated regulary is a good way to keep users coming back, and is also good for seo
